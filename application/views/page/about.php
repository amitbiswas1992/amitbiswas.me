<h3>Who I am..</h3>

<!-- <p>Learning for me is always a very exciting venture.I believe that knowledge gained is something no one can take away from me once it is acquired.   In reviewing the course package at BrainStation, I was most excited to see the focus on iOS development.  IOS development is my main passion and I would like to acquire as many new skills through the program.  I spoke in depth about the course components with one of the learning advisors, Mr. Mitch.</p>
<p>I also gave him a good idea about my programming experience and we spoke about Object Oriented Programming.  He encouraged me to apply to the program and agreed that I would benefit greatly from the courses available. Another aspect of BrainStation’s course design that excited me was the interactive live classes.  It’s always valuable to be able to get direct feedback and ask questions as they arise.  It is also imperative to get direct consultation from professionals in the industry that</p>
<p>can share real world proficiency. Overall, I really enjoy the way the entire program is constructed and the benefits I will reap after its completion.</p> -->
<p>I am a 26 year old Entrepreneurial App Developer who has been working in software development since 2014.
Nowadays, I primarily code IOS apps using Xcode and Swift.  While my roots began with more native programming languages, I quickly learning the iOS app development was my passion. </p>
<p> What keeps me going and interested in this field is the one question that I always ask myself, “How can I make this work?” I have a belief that if I can bring an idea into reality, I can somehow make a contribution to our evolving tech world. </p>

<h3>What I believe..</h3>

<a href='https://thalamus.ai'></a>
Over the years, my focus within the computer science space has transformed as my dreams have become bigger and as my knowledge has advanced.  Leaving my mark as an iOS developer drives my intention in all of my work. As a developer, I have become committed to solving problems that I have come to know of or experienced myself and try to create a solution for it.   You see your app idea as a company or a business and you build your app because you believe in that idea. But really my dream is to utilize my skills to make the world a better place by solving real life problems.
Where I am headed…
While I don’t know exactly what the future holds, I am interested in building a startup platform that also operates as an app (one component in a multi-interface solution) that can elevate the state of community communication and will have much greater capabilities within them.  My dream is to create something that will streamline the user experience and become and innovative part of our culture.

<p>
<a href='https://meducation.net'></a>
Swift is one of my favorite programming languages that I have utilized in app development.  I especially appreciate its expressiveness and readability and it’s capability to reduce development time and error.  Currently, I am using all of the program’s features and its vast source of dynamic libraries which allow me to create robust, yet adaptable applications.
